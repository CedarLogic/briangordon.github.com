You are given a set of rectangles in no particular order. They have varying widths and heights, but their bottom edges are collinear, so that they look like buildings on a skyline. Specifically, for each rectangle you're given the x position of the left edge, the x position of the right edge, and the height of the rectangle. The rectangles can overlap arbitrarily. Your task is to draw an outline around the buildings so that you can see what the skyline would look like when silhouetted at night.

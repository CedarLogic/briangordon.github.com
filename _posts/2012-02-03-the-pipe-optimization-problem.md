A number of well pumps have been built in arbitrary positions throughout a region. An east-west pipeline is to be built through the area with north-south connections off the main pipeline to each pump. Your task is to decide where to place the pipeline so that the total length of pipe that needs to be laid is minimized. An example map of the region is below; click the image to expand it. I claim that this choice of position for the pipeline is optimal: you cannot find any position which reduces the total length of pipe required to build the system.

Shorter pipes running north-south connect each pump station to its closest point on the main east-west pipe.](/images/optimal-thumb.png "An optimal positioning for the east-west pipeline in this pump configuration.")](/images/optimal.png)

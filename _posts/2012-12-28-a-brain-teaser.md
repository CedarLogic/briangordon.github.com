These two brain teasers posted on [/r/math](http://reddit.com/r/math/) impressed me greatly, so I decided to present them here.

You have been abducted by terrorists and blindfolded. They sit you down at a table and tell you that if you can solve two puzzles then they will let you go.

> There is a deck of 52 cards on the table in front of you. Ten of them are face-up and the rest are face-down. Split the deck into halves such that each half has an equal number of face-up cards.

You sit thinking for a few minutes. The terrorists are growing impatient around you when you finally smile and count out 26 cards from the deck. You put them aside as one half-deck. Of the remaining 26 cards, you flip the top 10 cards over to make the other half-deck.

The terrorists are impressed, but you have a yet harder challenge to face before they will let you go.

> On one side of the table there are five dice which add up to 15. On the other side of the table there are another five dice which add up to 13. Move some dice around so that the two sides of the table have equal sums.

You furrow your brow and sit thinking in darkness for over an hour. The terrorists' new respect for you is wearing off quickly, and they won't wait much longer. Finally, you get it. You take one die from the group on the right and move it to the group on the left. Then you flip the remaining 4 dice of the right group. "You see," you explain carefully. "If the left group sums to \\(k\\), then the right group sums to \\(28-k\\). If you take a die \\(b\\) from the right group and move it to the left, then the new sums are \\(k+b\\) and \\(28-k-b\\). Now if we flip each of the dice in the right group, we have:" $$28-(28-k-b)=k+b$$
